* game1.py is a 2-player terminal-based version of the game.
* game2.py has a dependency on gametools.py and it is a GUI based interactive 2 player PLOT-4 Game.

> Next Steps:
1. Creating a single player game where computer randomly decides where to put the piece.
2. Using OOPs to implement the code base.
3. Implementing AI algorithm to make an interesting single player game.
